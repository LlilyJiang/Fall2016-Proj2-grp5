A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (/ˈbɛtjʊlə/),[2] in 
the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams, and is closely 
related to the beech-oak family, Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa 
of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Green List of Threatened Species. They are a typically 
rather short-lived pioneer species widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in 
northern temperate and boreal climates.

Birch species are generally small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, mostly of northern 
temperate and boreal climates. The simple leaves are alternate, singly or doubly serrate, 
feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are 
really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets.[4] The fruit is a small samara, 
although the wings may be obscure in some species. They differ from the alders (Alnus, 
other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are not woody and disintegrate at 
maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody, cone-like female alder catkins.

The bark of all birches is characteristically marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and 
often separates into thin, papery plates, especially upon the paper birch. Its decided color 
gives the common names gray, white, black, silver and yellow birch to different species.

The buds form early and are full grown by midsummer, all are lateral, no terminal bud is 
formed; the branch is prolonged by the upper lateral bud. The wood of all the species is 
close-grained with satiny texture, and capable of taking a fine polish; its fuel value is fair.
