Syringa (lilac) is a genus of 12 currently recognized [1] species of flowering woody plants 
in the olive family (Oleaceae), native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern 
Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.

The genus is most closely related to Ligustrum (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus 
Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.
Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including copper 
underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.

They are small trees, ranging in size from 2 to 10 metres (6 ft 7 in to 32 ft 10 in) tall, 
with stems up to 20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 in) diameter. The leaves are opposite 
(occasionally in whorls of three) in arrangement, and their shape is simple and heart-shaped 
to broad lanceolate in most species, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. S. protolaciniata, 
S. pinnatifolia). The flowers are produced in spring, each flower being 5 to 10 millimetres 
(0.20 to 0.39 in) in diameter with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube narrow, 5 to 20 
millimetres (0.20 to 0.79 in) long; they are bisexual, with fertile stamens and stigma in 
each flower. The usual flower colour is a shade of purple (often a light purple or lilac), 
but white, pale yellow and pink, and even a dark burgundy color are also found. The flowers 
grow in large panicles, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering varies 
between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species. The fruit is a dry, brown 
capsule, splitting in two at maturity to release the two winged seeds.
