Crataegus (/krəˈtiːɡəs/),[3] (from the Greek κράτος kratos strength and άκης akis sharp, 
referring to the thorns of some species[4]) commonly called hawthorn, thornapple,[5] May-tree,
[6] whitethorn,[6] or hawberry, is a large genus of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, 
native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America. 
The name "hawthorn" was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, 
especially the common hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in 
Britain and Ireland. The name is now also applied to the entire genus and to the related 
Asian genus Rhaphiolepis. The name haw, originally an Old English term for hedge, applies 
to the fruit.

Description
Crataegus species are shrubs or small trees, mostly growing to 5–15 metres (16–49 ft) tall,
with small pome fruit and (usually) thorny branches. The most common type of bark is smooth 
grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in 
older trees. The thorns are small sharp-tipped branches that arise either from other branches 
or from the trunk, and are typically 1–3 cm long (recorded as up to 11.5 centimetres (4.5 in) 
in one case[7]). The leaves grow spirally arranged on long shoots, and in clusters on spur 
shoots on the branches or twigs. The leaves of most species have lobed or serrate margins 
and are somewhat variable in shape. The fruit, sometimes known as a "haw", is berry-like 
but structurally a pome containing from 1 to 5 pyrenes that resemble the "stones" of plums, 
peaches, etc., which are drupaceous fruit in the same subfamily.
