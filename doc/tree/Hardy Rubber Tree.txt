The rubber tree, is a tree belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is the most economically 
important member of the genus Hevea. It is of major economic importance because the milky 
latex extracted from the tree is the primary source of natural rubber.

In the wild, the tree can reach a height of up to 100 feet (30 m). The white or yellow latex 
occurs in latex vessels in the bark, mostly outside the phloem. These vessels spiral up the 
tree in a right-handed helix which forms an angle of about 30 degrees with the horizontal, 
and can grow as high as 45 ft.

In plantations, the trees are generally smaller for two reasons: 1) trees grow more slowly 
when they are tapped for latex, and 2) trees are generally cut down after only 30 years, 
because latex production declines as trees age, and they are no longer economically productive.

The tree requires a tropical or subtropical climate with a minimum of about 1,200 mm per 
year of rainfall, and no frost.[1] If frost does occur, the results can be disastrous for 
production. One frost can cause the rubber from an entire plantation to become brittle and 
break once it has been refined.
