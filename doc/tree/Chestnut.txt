shrubs in the beech family Fagaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

Chestnut trees are of moderate growth rate (for the Chinese chestnut tree) to fast-growing 
for American and European species.[18] Their mature heights vary from the smallest species 
of chinkapins, often shrubby,[19] to the giant of past American forests, C. dentata that 
could reach 60 m. Between these extremes are found the Japanese chestnut (C. crenata) at 
10 m average;[Note 1] followed by the Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) at about 15 m, then 
the European chestnut (C. sativa) around 30 m.

The Chinese and more so the Japanese chestnuts are both often multileadered and wide-spreading,
[10] whereas European and especially American species tend to grow very erect when planted 
among others, with little tapering of their columnar trunks, which are firmly set and massive. 
When standing on their own, they spread on the sides and develop broad, rounded, dense crowns 
at maturity.[18] The two latter's foliage has striking yellow autumn colouring.

Its bark is smooth when young,of a vinous maroon or red-brown colour for the American 
chestnut,[12] grey for the European chestnut. With age, American species' bark becomes 
grey and darker, thick and deeply furrowed; the furrows run longitudinally, and tend to 
twist around the trunk as the tree ages; it sometimes reminds one of a large cable with 
twisted strands.

The leaves are simple, ovate or lanceolate, 10–30 cm long and 4–10 cm wide, with sharply 
pointed, widely spaced teeth, with shallow rounded sinuates between.
