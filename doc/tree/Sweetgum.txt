Liquidambar styraciflua, commonly called American sweetgum, sweetgum, sweet gum, sweet-gum
(sweet gum in the UK),[2] hazel pine,[3] American-storax,[1] bilsted,[4] red-gum, satin-walnut,
[1] star-leaved gum,[4] or alligator-wood[1] is a deciduous tree in the genus Liquidambar 
native to warm temperate areas of eastern North America and tropical montane regions of Mexico 
and Central America. Sweet gum is one of the main valuable forest trees in the southeastern 
United States, and is a popular ornamental tree in temperate climates. It is recognizable 
by the combination of its five-pointed star-shaped leaves and its hard, spiked fruits. 
It is currently classified in the plant family Altingiaceae, but was formerly considered 
a member of the Hamamelidaceae.

Description
Size
Liquidambar styraciflua is a medium-sized to large tree, growing anywhere from 50–70 feet 
(15–21 m) in cultivation and up to 150 feet (46 m) in the wild,[11] with a trunk up 2–3 feet 
(0.61–0.91 m) in diameter, on average.[12] Trees may live to 400 years.[13] The tree is a 
symmetrical shape and crowns into an egg shape when the branches get too heavy after its 
first two years of cultivation.

Bark and branches
Another distinctive feature of the tree is the peculiar appearance of its small branches and twigs. 
The bark attaches itself to these in plates edgewise instead of laterally, and a piece of 
the leafless branch with the aid of a little imagination readily takes on a reptilian form; 
indeed, the tree is sometimes called Alligator-wood.[9] The bark is a light brown tinged 
with red and sometimes gray with dark streaks and weighs 37 lbs. per cubic foot.[12] It is 
deeply fissured with scaly ridges.[9] The branches carry layers of cork.[14] The branchlets 
are pithy, many-angled, winged, and at first covered with rusty hairs, finally becoming red 
brown, gray or dark brown.[9] As an ornamental tree, the species has a drawback—the branches 
may have ridges or "wings" that cause more surface area, increasing weight of snow and ice 
accumulation on the tree. However, the wood is heavy and hard with an interlocking grain,
but is difficult to season.
