Tree of heaven is a deciduous tree in the Simaroubaceae family. It is native to both 
northeast and central China, as well as Taiwan. Unlike other members of the genus Ailanthus, 
it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is 
capable of reaching heights of 15 metres (49 ft) in 25 years. However, the species is also 
short lived and rarely lives more than 50 years, though its remarkable suckering ability 
makes it possible for this tree to clone itself indefinitely and live considerably longer 
(since they are linked to the mother tree and thus partly fed by it, the suckers are less 
vulnerable than the seedlings and can grow faster).

A. altissima is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27 metres (56 and 89 ft) 
with a diameter at breast height of about 1 metre (39 inches).[4] The bark is smooth and light grey, 
often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, 
smooth to lightly pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have lenticels as well as 
heart-shaped leaf scars (i.e. a scar left on the twig after a leaf falls) with many bundle 
scars (i.e. small marks where the veins of the leaf once connected to the tree) around the 
edges. The buds are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the petiole, 
though they are completely visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.
The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous, and containing raised 
lenticels that become fissures with age. The ends of the branches become pendulous. All 
parts of the plant have a distinguishing strong odour that is often likened to peanuts, 
cashews,[6] or rotting cashews.[7]
