Morus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, comprises 10–16 species of deciduous 
trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate 
world regions.

The closely related genus Broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry, notably the paper 
mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera. Mulberries are fast-growing when young, but soon become 
slow-growing and rarely exceed 10–15 m (33–49 ft) tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, 
simple and often lobed and serrated on the margin. Lobes are more common on juvenile shoots 
than on mature trees.

The trees can be monoecious or dioecious.[3][4] The mulberry fruit is a multiple fruit, 
2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) long. Immature fruits are white, green, or pale yellow. In most 
species the fruits turn pink and then red while ripening, then dark purple or black, 
and have a sweet flavor when fully ripe. The fruits of the white-fruited cultivar are 
white when ripe; the fruit of this cultivar is also sweet, but has a very bland flavor 
compared with darker varieties.
