Cornus is a genus of about 30â€“60 species[Note 1] of woody plants in the family Cornaceae, 
commonly known as dogwoods, which can generally be distinguished by their blossoms, berries, 
and distinctive bark.[2] Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly 
herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and a few of the woody species are evergreen. Several species 
have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically 
white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. 
The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia 
and North America, with China and Japan and the southeastern United States particularly 
rich in native species.

Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated 
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus 
nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and 
two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), 
Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.

Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine 
genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus Cornus is accepted here.
