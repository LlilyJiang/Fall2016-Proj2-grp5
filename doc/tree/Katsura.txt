The type species, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, can reach 45 m (148 ft) in height, and is one 
of the largest hardwoods in Asia. The other species, Cercidiphyllum magnificum, is much 
smaller, rarely reaching over 10 m (33 ft) in height. Cercidiphyllum produces spurs along 
its twigs. These are short stems with closely spaced leaves. The foliage is dimorphic. 
According to a recent description "short shoots bear broadly cordate or reniform, palmately 
veined leaves with crenate margins; long shoots bear elliptic to broadly ovate leaves with 
entire or finely serrate margins." [2] Leaf size varies from 3–8 cm long and 3-5.5 cm broad. 
The genus is dioecious, having separate male and female trees. The small inconspicuous flowers 
are produced in early spring and wind-pollinated; the fruit is a cluster of 2-4 small pods, 
each pod 1–2 cm long with numerous small, flattened and winged seeds. The fruits mature in 
autumn and release their seeds in autumn through winter.
