Alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants (Alnus) belonging to the birch family 
Betulaceae. The genus comprises about 35[2] species of monoecious trees and shrubs, a few 
reaching a large size, distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species 
extending into Central America, as well as the northern and southern Andes.

With a few exceptions, alders are deciduous, and the leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated. 
The flowers are catkins with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, 
often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by bees to a 
small extent. These trees differ from the birches (Betula, the other genus in the family) 
in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release 
the seeds in a similar manner to many conifer cones.

The largest species are red alder (A. rubra) on the west coast of North America, and black 
alder (A. glutinosa), native to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching 
over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread Alnus viridis (green alder) is rarely more than a 
5-m-tall shrub.
