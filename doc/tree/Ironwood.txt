Description
The desert ironwood grows as a bush or tree and reaches heights of about 10 metres (33 ft), 
and average trunk diameters of about 60 cm (24 in); in exceptional sites in larger protected 
washes, greater height and more massive.

In younger trees, the bark is gray, shiny, and smooth; in older trees the bark is broken open. 
The tree is an evergreen plant, but can lose its leaves if temperatures fall below 2 °C (36 °F). 
In continual drought conditions leaves will be lost.

Leaves are bluish-green and pinnately compound. Leaves are arranged on a petiole, 6 in (15 cm) 
long, with 6-9 leaflets-(or variously up to 15, 7, 7-opposite, and one terminal), each being 
0.7 to 2.5 cm (0.28 to 0.98 in). At the base of each pinnate leaf petiole grow two thorns, 
about 1 cm (0.39 in) long.

Bloom time occurs in late April/May to June. Flowers are of 5 unequal petals, in colors of 
medium purple, magenta-red, or also white to pale pink. Seedpods are 5–8 cm (2–4 in) long, 
and light reddish brown. When seedpods are ripened two other species Parkinsonia florida-
(Blue Palo Verde), and Acacia constricta-(Catclaw Acacia) have similar light red brownish 
colors. Catclaw acacia seedpods are noticeably J-shaped and of shorter length.
