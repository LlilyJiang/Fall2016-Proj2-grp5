Elms are deciduous and semi-deciduous trees comprising the flowering plant genus Ulmus in 
the plant family Ulmaceae. The genus first appeared in the Miocene geological period about 
20 million years ago, originating in what is now central Asia.[1] These trees flourished 
and spread over most of the Northern Hemisphere, inhabiting the temperate and tropical-montane 
regions of North America and Eurasia, presently ranging southward across the Equator into 
Indonesia.

Elms are components of many kinds of natural forests. Moreover, during the 19th and early 
20th centuries many species and cultivars were also planted as ornamental street, garden, 
and park trees in Europe, North America, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, notably Australasia. 
Some individual elms reached great size and age. However, in recent decades, most mature elms 
of European or North American origin have died from Dutch elm disease, caused by a microfungus 
dispersed by bark beetles. In response, disease-resistant cultivars have been developed, 
capable of restoring the elm to forestry and landscaping.

The genus is hermaphroditic, having apetalous perfect flowers which are wind-pollinated. 
Elm leaves are alternate, with simple, single- or, most commonly, doubly serrate margins, 
usually asymmetric at the base and acuminate at the apex. The fruit is a round wind-dispersed 
samara flushed with chlorophyll, facilitating photosynthesis before the leaves emerge.
All species are tolerant of a wide range of soils and pH levels but, with few exceptions, 
demand good drainage. The elm tree can grow to great height, often with a split trunk 
creating a vase-shape profile.
