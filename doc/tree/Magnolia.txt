Magnolia is a large genus of about 210[notes 1] flowering plant species in the subfamily 
Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol.

Magnolia is an ancient genus. Appearing before bees did, the flowers are theorized to have 
evolved to encourage pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, 
the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough.[1] Fossilised specimens of M. acuminata 
have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the 
Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago.[2] Another aspect of Magnolia considered to 
represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in 
sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct 
sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering 
plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as 
well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).

The natural range of Magnolia species is a disjunct distribution, with a main centre in 
east and southeast Asia and a secondary centre in eastern North America, Central America, 
the West Indies, and some species in South America.

As with all Magnoliaceae, the perianth is undifferentiated, with 9â€“15 tepals in 3 or more whorls. 
The flowers are bisexual with numerous adnate carpels and stamens are arranged in a spiral 
fashion on the elongated receptacle. The fruit dehisces along their dorsal sutures. 
The pollen is monocolpate, and the embryo development is of the Polygonium type.
