An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/ˈkwɜːrkəs/;[1] Latin "oak tree") of the 
beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name
"oak" may also appear in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus. The 
genus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species 
extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and 
North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately
90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. 
The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 
species.[2]

Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated
leaves or entire leaf with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not 
dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers
(in the form of catkins) and small female flowers.[3] The fruit is a nut called an acorn,
borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two 
or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on their species. The live oaks are 
distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are 
dispersed across the genus.
