Coffea is a genus of flowering plants whose seeds, called coffee beans, are used to make 
various coffee beverages and products. It is a member of the family Rubiaceae. They are 
shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa and tropical Asia. Coffee 
ranks as one of the world's most valuable and widely traded commodity crops and is an 
important export product of several countries, including those in Central and South America, 
the Caribbean and Africa.

Several species of Coffea may be grown for the seeds. Coffea arabica accounts for 75-80 
percent of the world's coffee production, while Coffea canephora accounts for about 20 percent.
The trees produce edible red or purple fruits called "cherries" that are described either 
as epigynous berries or as indehiscent drupes.[2] The cherries contain two seeds, the 
so-called "coffee beans", which—despite their name—are not true beans. In about 5-10% of 
any crop of coffee cherries, only a single bean, rather than the usual two, is found. 
This is called a peaberry, which is smaller and rounder than a normal coffee bean. It is 
often removed from the yield and either sold separately (as in New Guinea peaberry), 
or discarded.
When grown in the tropics, coffee is a vigorous bush or small tree that usually grows to a 
height of 3–3.5 m (9.8–11.5 ft). Most commonly cultivated coffee species grow best at high 
elevations, but do not tolerate freezing temperatures.
The tree of Coffea arabica will grow fruits after three to five years, and will produce for 
about 50 to 60 years (although up to 100 years is possible).[citation needed] The white 
flowers are highly scented. The fruit takes about 9 months to ripen.
