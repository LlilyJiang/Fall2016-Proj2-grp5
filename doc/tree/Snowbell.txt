Styrax is a genus of about 130 species of large shrubs or small trees in the family Styracaceae, 
mostly native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the 
majority in eastern and southeastern Asia, but also crossing the equator in South America.
Common names include snowbell,[2] styrax, and the more ambiguous storax and benzoin.

The genus Pamphilia, sometimes regarded as distinct, is now included within Styrax based on 
analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data.[3] The spicebush (Lindera benzoin) is a 
different plant, in the family Lauraceae.

Styrax trees grow to 2–14 m tall, and have alternate, deciduous or evergreen simple ovate 
leaves 1–18 cm long and 2–10 cm broad. The flowers are pendulous, with a white 5–10-lobed 
corolla, produced 3–30 together on open or dense panicles 5–25 cm long. The fruit is an 
oblong dry drupe, smooth and lacking ribs or narrow wings, unlike the fruit of the related 
snowdrop trees (Halesia) and epaulette trees (Pterostyrax).
