Chionanthus /ˌkaɪoʊˈnænθəs/, common name: fringetrees, is a genus of about 150 species of 
flowering plants in the family Oleaceae.


The genus has a wide distribution primarily in the tropics and subtropics, but with three 
species extending north into temperate regions, one (C. retusus) in eastern Asia and two 
(C. virginicus and C. henryae) in eastern North America.[1][2] Most of the tropical species 
are evergreen, while the three temperate species are deciduous. Some botanists restrict 
Chionanthus to the deciduous, temperate species, treating the evergreen species in a separate 
genus Linociera, but apart from leaf persistence, there is no other consistent difference 
between them.

They are shrubs and small to medium-sized trees growing to 3–25 m tall. The leaves are 
opposite, simple. The flowers are produced in feathery panicles, with a corolla subdivided 
into four slender lobes; they are white, pale yellow, or tinged pink. The fruit is a drupe 
containing a single seed.
