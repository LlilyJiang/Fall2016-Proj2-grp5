Phellodendron amurense is a species of tree in the family Rutaceae, commonly called the 
Amur cork tree. It is a major source of one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional 
Chinese medicine. The Ainu people used this plant, called shikerebe-ni, as a painkiller.

Native to eastern Asia; northern China, northeast China, Korea, Ussuri, Amur, and Japan, 
the Amur cork tree is considered invasive in many parts of North America. The State of 
Massachusetts lists it as a noxious weed.

As an ornamental plant, Phellodendron is a tree for all seasons. In spring it has yellow flowers, 
in summer it provides foliage and shade, in fall the leaves turn bright yellow, and the 
textured bark and winding branches add interest in the winter. The female bears black drupes 
that attract birds and other wildlife through the late fall and winter.

The cork-tree is resistant to drought and insects, and it can thrive in a variety of soils. 
It is hardy to zone 4 and it is easy to maintain, sometimes to the point of being invasive. 
One drawback is that the drupes fall and scatter, which may be undesirable on a formal lawn.

The bark in some species is thick, resembling that of the cork oak, but is not thick enough 
for commercial cork production. It has been used to produce a yellow dye.
