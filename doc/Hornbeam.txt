Hornbeams are hardwood trees in the flowering plant genus Carpinus in the birch family Betulaceae. 
The 30–40 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.

Hornbeams are small to medium-sized trees, Carpinus betulus reaching a height of 32 m.
The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary 
from 3–10 cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. 
The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). 
The fruit is a small nut about 3–6 mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either 
trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes 
it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing is important in the 
identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.
