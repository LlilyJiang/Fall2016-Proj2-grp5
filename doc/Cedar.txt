Cedrus (common name cedar) is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae. 
They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, 
occurring at altitudes of 1,500–3,200 m in the Himalayas and 1,000–2,200 m in the Mediterranean.

Cedrus trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented 
wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches. The shoots are 
dimorphic, with long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, 
which carry most of the nbsp;mm long, arranged in an open spiral phyllotaxis on long shoots, 
and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright 
grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness 
of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation. The seed cones are 
barrel-shaped, 6–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in Abies, 
disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. The seeds are 10–15 mm long, with a 
20–30 mm wing; as in Abies, the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an 
unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation. Cone maturation 
takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later. 
The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3–8 cm long, produced in late summer, and shedding 
pollen in autumn.
