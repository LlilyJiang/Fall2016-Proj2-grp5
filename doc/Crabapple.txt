Malus is a genus of about 30–35 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the 
family Rosaceae.[1] Other studies say it includes 55 species,[2] including the domesticated 
orchard apple, or table apple as it used to be called. The other species and subspecies are 
generally known as "wild apples", "crab apples", "crabapples" or "crabs".

The genus is native to the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and 
North America.

Apple trees are small, usually 4–12 m tall when full grown. The leaves are 3–10 cm long, 
positioned opposite from each other. They have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge. The 
flowers come from corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, with 
usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen, and an ovary which is below them. Flowering 
takes place in the spring and pollination is by insects (typically bees, which freely visit 
the flowers for both nectar and pollen).
