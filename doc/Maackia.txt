Maackia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. There are about 12 
species, all native to eastern Asia, with six endemic to China.[2] The generic name honors 
the botanist Richard Maack.

They are deciduous trees and shrubs. The alternately arranged leaves are divided into leaflets. 
The inflorescence is a simple or compound raceme of many flowers. Each flower has an inflated 
calyx with five teeth. The white or greenish corolla has a reflexed standard petal and keel 
petals that are fused at the bases. The fruit is a wide or narrow, flattened legume pod 
containing one to five flat seeds.
