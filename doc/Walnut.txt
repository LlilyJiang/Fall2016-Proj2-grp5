Walnut trees are any species of tree in the plant genus Juglans, the type genus of the family 
Juglandaceae, the seeds of which are referred to as walnuts. All species are deciduous trees, 
10–40 metres (33–131 ft) tall, with pinnate leaves 200–900 millimetres (7.9–35.4 in), with 
5–25 leaflets; the shoots have chambered pith, a character shared with the wingnuts (Pterocarya), 
but not the hickories (Carya) in the same family.

The 21 species in the genus range across the north temperate Old World from southeast Europe 
east to Japan, and more widely in the New World from southeast Canada west to California 
and south to Argentina.
