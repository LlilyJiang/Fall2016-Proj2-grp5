Pseudotsuga menziesii, commonly known as Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer species native 
to western North America.

Coast Douglas fir is currently the second-tallest conifer in the world (after coast redwood).
Extant coast Douglas fir trees 60–75 m (195–245 ft) or more in height and 1.5–2 m (4.9–6.6 ft) 
in diameter are common in old growth stands, and maximum heights of 100–120 m (330–395 ft) 
and diameters up to 4.5–6 m (14 ft 9 in–19 ft 8 in) have been documented.[citation needed] 
The tallest living specimen is the "Doerner Fir", previously known as the Brummit Fir, 99.4 m 
(326 ft 1 in) tall, at East Fork Brummit Creek in Coos County, Oregon, the stoutest is the 
"Queets Fir", 4.85 m (15 ft 11 in) in diameter, in the Queets River valley of Olympic National 
Park in Washington. Douglas firs commonly live more than 500 years and occasionally more than 
1,000 years.

The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, and gray,[7] and contains numerous resin blisters. 
On mature trees, it is thick and corky.[7] The shoots are brown to olive-green, turning 
gray-brown with age, smooth, though not as smooth as fir shoots, and finely pubescent with 
short, dark hairs. The buds are a very distinctive, narrow, conic shape, 4–8 mm (5⁄32–5⁄16 in) 
long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged, but slightly twisted at the 
base to lie flattish on either side of the shoot, needle-like, 2–3.5 cm (3⁄4–1 3⁄8 in) long, 
green above with no stomata, and with two whitish stomatal bands below. Unlike the Rocky 
Mountain Douglas fir, coast Douglas fir foliage has a noticeable sweet fruity-resinous scent,
[7] particularly if crushed.
