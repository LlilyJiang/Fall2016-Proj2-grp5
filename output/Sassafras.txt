Sassafras is a genus of three extant and one extinct species of deciduous trees in the family 
Lauraceae, native to eastern North America and eastern Asia.[1][2][3] The genus is distinguished 
by its aromatic properties, which have made the tree useful to humans.

Sassafras trees grow from 9–35 m (30–115 ft) tall with many slender sympodial branches, and 
smooth, orange-brown bark or yellow bark.[8] All parts of the plants are fragrant. The species 
are unusual in having three distinct leaf patterns on the same plant: unlobed oval, bilobed 
(mitten-shaped), and trilobed (three-pronged); the leaves are hardly ever five-lobed.[9] 
Three-lobed leaves are more common in sassafras tzumu and sassafras randaiense than in their 
North American counterparts, although three-lobed leaves do sometimes occur on sassafras 
albidum. The young leaves and twigs are quite mucilaginous, and produce a citrus-like scent 
when crushed. The tiny, yellow flowers are five-petaled; sassafras albidum and sassafras 
hesperia are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees, while sassafras 
tzumu and sassafras randaiense have male and female flowers occurring on the same trees. 
The fruit is a drupe, blue-black when ripe.[1]

The largest known sassafras tree in the world is located in Owensboro, Kentucky, and measures 
over 100 feet high and 21 feet in circumference.
