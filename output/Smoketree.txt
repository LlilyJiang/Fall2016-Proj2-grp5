Smoketree or Smoke bush (Cotinus /koʊˈtaɪnəs/) is a genus of two species of flowering plants 
in the family Anacardiaceae, closely related to the sumacs (Rhus).

They are large shrubs or small trees, native to the warm temperate northern hemisphere. 
The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple oval shape, 3–13 cm long. The flowers are 
clustered in a large open terminal panicles 15–30 cm long with a fluffy grayish-buff 
appearance resembling a cloud of smoke over the plant, from which the name derives. The 
fruit is a small drupe with a single seed. Often classified in Rhus in the past, they are 
distinguished by the leaves being simple (not pinnate) and the 'smoke-like' fluffy flower 
heads.
