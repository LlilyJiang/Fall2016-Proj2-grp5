Catalpa, commonly called catalpa or catawba, is a genus of flowering plants in the family 
Bignoniaceae, native to warm temperate and subtropical regions of North America, the Caribbean, 
and East Asia.

Mostly deciduous trees, they typically grow to 12–18 metres (39–59 ft) tall and 6–12 metres 
(20–39 ft) wide. A 10-year-old sapling stands about 6 metres (20 ft) tall. They can be 
recognized by their large, heart-shaped to three-lobed leaves, showy white or yellow flowers 
in broad panicles. In the autumn they bear 20–50 centimetres (7.9–19.7 in) long fruits that 
resemble a slender bean pod full of small flat seeds, each with two thin wings to aid in 
wind dispersal. Because of the leaves, they are sometimes confused with the tung tree (Vernicia fordii) 
in the southern U.S., or the invasive Paulownia tomentosa from China.

Due to their large leaf size, catalpas are a popular habitat for many birds, providing them 
good shelter from rain and wind. These trees have few limb droppage, but drop large dark-brown 
bean pods during late summer. The wood of catalpas is quite soft.

Catalpas begin flowering after roughly 3 years, and produce seed pods after approximately 5 years.
