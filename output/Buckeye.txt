The genus Aesculus comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the soapberry and lychee 
family Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, 
with 6 species native to North America and 7–13 species native to Eurasia. There are also 
several hybrids. Aesculus exhibits a classical arcto-Tertiary distribution.

Aesculus species have stout shoots with resinous, often sticky, buds; opposite, palmately 
divided leaves, often very large—to 65 cm (26 in) across in the Japanese horse chestnut 
Aesculus turbinata. Species are deciduous or evergreen. Flowers are showy, insect- or 
bird-pollinated, with four or five petals fused into a lobed corolla tube, arranged in a 
panicle inflorescence. Flowering starts after 80–110 growing degree days. The fruit matures 
to a capsule, 2–5 cm (25⁄32–1 31⁄32 in) diameter, usually globose, containing one to three 
seeds (often erroneously called a nut) per capsule. Capsules containing more than one seed 
result in flatness on one side of the seeds. The point of attachment of the seed in the 
capsule (hilum) shows as a large circular whitish scar. The capsule epidermis has "spines" 
(botanically: prickles) in some species, while other capsules are warty or smooth. At maturity, 
the capsule splits into three sections to release the seeds.

Aesculus seeds were traditionally eaten, after leaching, by the Jōmon people of Japan over 
about four millennia, until 300 AD.
