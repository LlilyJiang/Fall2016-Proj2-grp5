Larches are conifers in the genus Larix, in the family Pinaceae. Growing from 20 to 45 m 
tall (65 to 147 ft),[1] they are native to much of the cooler temperate northern hemisphere, 
on lowlands in the north and high on mountains further south. Larches are among the dominant 
plants in the boreal forests of Siberia and Canada.

Although they are conifers, larches are deciduous trees that lose their leaves in the autumn. 
The shoots are dimorphic, with leaves borne singly on long shoots typically 10–50 centimetres 
long[2]:47 and bearing several buds, and in dense clusters of 20-50 needles on short shoots 
only 1–2 mm long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, 2–5 centimetres long, 
slender (under 1 cm wide). The needles are deciduous, turning yellow and falling singly in 
the late autumn, leaving the trees leafless through the winter.

The female cones of larches cones are erect, small, 1–9 cm long, green or purple, ripening 
brown 5–8 months after pollination; in about half the species the bract scales are long and 
visible, and in the others, short and hidden between the seed scales. Those native to northern 
regions have small cones (1–3 cm) with short bracts, with more southerly species tending to 
have longer cones (3–9 cm), often with exserted bracts, with the longest cones and bracts 
produced by the southernmost species, in the Himalayas.
