Populus deltoides, the eastern cottonwood[1] or necklace poplar,[2] is a cottonwood poplar 
native to North America, growing throughout the eastern, central, and southwestern United 
States, the southernmost part of eastern Canada, and northeastern Mexico.It is a eudicot.

Populus deltoides is a large tree growing to 20–40 m (65–130 ft) tall and with a trunk up 
to 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) diameter, one of the largest North American hardwood trees. The bark 
is silvery-white, smooth or lightly fissured when young, becoming dark gray and deeply fissured 
on old trees. The twigs are grayish-yellow and stout, with large triangular leaf scars. 
The winter buds are slender, pointed, 1–2 centimetres (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) long, yellowish brown, 
and resinous. It is one of the fastest growing trees in North America. In Mississippi River 
bottoms, height growth of 10–15 feet (5–5 m) per year for a few years have been seen. 
Sustained height growth of 5-foot (1.5-meter) height growth and 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) 
diameter growth per year for 25 years is common.

The leaves are large, deltoid (triangular), 4–10 cm (1 1⁄2–4 in) long and 4–11 cm (1 1⁄2–4 1⁄4 in) 
broad with a truncated (flattened) base and a petiole 3–12 cm (1 1⁄4–4 3⁄4 in) long. 
The leaf is very coarsely toothed, the teeth are curved and gland tipped, and the petiole 
is flat; they are dark green in the summer and turn yellow in the fall (but many cottonwoods 
in dry locations drop their leaves early from the combination of drought and leaf rust, 
making their fall color dull or absent). Due to the flat stem of the leaf, the leaf has 
the tendency to shake from even the slightest breeze. This is one of the identifying 
characteristics.[4]

It is dioecious, with the flowers (catkins) produced on single-sex trees in early spring. 
The male (pollen) catkins are reddish-purple and 8–10 cm (3 1⁄4–4 in) long; the female 
catkins are green, 7–13 cm (2 3⁄4–5 in) long at pollination, maturing 15–20 cm (6–7 3⁄4 in) 
long with several 6-to-15-millimeter (1⁄4-to-9⁄16-inch) seed capsules in early summer, which 
split open to release the numerous small seeds attached to cotton-like strands.
